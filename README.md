The purpose of this dataset is to support a Final Year Project focused on British Sign Language (BSL) number and alphabet recognition in live video. The project is part of a Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence degree programme at Brunel University London.

Requirements:

* Python, v:3.11.8
* Opencv-python (cv2), v:4.9.0
* MediaPipe, v:0.10.9
* Numpy, v:1.26.4
* Pandas, v:2.2.1
* Seaborn, v:0.13.2
* Matplotlib, v:3.8.3
* Scikit-learn (Sklearn), v1.4.1.post1
* Pickle
* Pathlib

The dataset comprises the following contents:

* A Python Notebook is utilised to capture images for the dataset.
* A Python Notebook is employed to generate a CSV file containing 21 Hand Landmarks for MediaPipe.
* A Python Notebook is utilised for training the model.
* A Python Notebook designed for the purpose of recognising numbers and alphabets in British Sign Language (BSL).

The dataset comprises the following contents:

* There are a total of 34,000 images expressing British Sign Language (BSL) numbers and alphabet. The dataset comprises British Sign Language (BSL) numerical values ranging from zero (0) to ten (10) and the alphabet, with the exception of the letters H, J, and Y.
* The 21 hand landmark location of MediPipe is represented by two CSV files.
* Two models trained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms.
